        Chocolate is a food made from roasted and ground cocoa beans that can be
        a liquid, solid, or paste, either on its own or as a flavoring in other
        foods. The cacao tree has been used as a source of food for at least
        5,300 years, starting with the Mayo-Chinchipe culture in what is
        present-day Ecuador. Later, Mesoamerican civilizations consumed cacao
        beverages, of which one, chocolate, was introduced to Europe in the 16th
        century. <br />
        The seeds of the cacao tree (Theobroma cacao) have an intense bitter
        taste and must be fermented to develop the flavor. After fermentation,
        the seeds are dried, cleaned, and roasted. The shell is removed to
        produce nibs, which are then ground to cocoa mass, unadulterated
        chocolate in rough form. Once the cocoa mass is liquefied by heating, it
        is called chocolate liquor. The liquor may also be cooled and processed
        into its two components: cocoa solids and cocoa butter. Baking
        chocolate, also called bitter chocolate, contains cocoa solids and cocoa
        butter in varying proportions without any added sugar. Powdered baking
        cocoa, which contains more fiber than cocoa butter, can be processed
        with alkali to produce Dutch cocoa. Much of the chocolate consumed today
        is in the form of sweet chocolate, a combination of cocoa solids, cocoa
        butter, and added vegetable oils and sugar. Milk chocolate is sweet
        chocolate that additionally contains milk powder. White chocolate
        contains cocoa butter, sugar, and milk, but no cocoa solids.
